== Running pmdabpf with valgrind
=== std out ===

bpf.disk.all.latency PMID: 157.0.0 [Disk latency]
    Data Type: 64-bit unsigned int  InDom: 157.0 0x27400000
    Semantics: counter  Units: microsec
Help:
Disk latency histogram across all disks, for both reads and writes.

bpf.runq.latency PMID: 157.1.0 [Run queue latency (ns)]
    Data Type: 64-bit unsigned int  InDom: 157.1 0x27400001
    Semantics: counter  Units: nanosec
Help:
Run queue latency from task switches,
ie: how long each task sat in queue from entry to queue until executing.
