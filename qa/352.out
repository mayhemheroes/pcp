The sample.long.* metrics provide a group of 32-bit integer metrics
some with fixed values and one with a value that can be changed via
pmstore(1).

This one has the constant value 1.

PMID: 511.2048.3 [This should be 9!]
PMID: 511.2048.4
Since this is 100 minus 1, we'd expect the answer to be exactly
>>> 99 <<<
on most days
PMID: 511.2048.5 [This should be 999900!]
PMID: 511.2048.5
Since this is 1,0000 minus 100 the answer is expected to be very
close to 999900, n'est ce pas?
